### Suggested reading

There are quite a few concepts within this project, in order to understand what is going on I would suggest looking at the following

* Facebook React http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html
* Om https://github.com/swannodette/om
* Chord https://github.com/james-henderson/chord

This is also a great read on why Om and React are the future of javascript MVC frameworks

## Usage

To compile the clojurescript and launch the web server.
